"""
Hello Everyone reading this code, I am Nicolas Fecko and this is my AlterAI program.
In short I wanted to make an alternative approach to Artifficial intelligence by giving Alter a Purpose in Mental health.
It runs a local model of gemma3:4b and initializes its custom personality via a personality prompt.

I am essentially rewriting and polishing a program I already made for ISEF Ko≈°ice 2025
